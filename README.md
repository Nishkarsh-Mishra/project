# 🛡️ Multimodal Fake News Detection System

### Fake News + Fake Image + Fake Audio + Fake Video Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Multimodal Fake News Detection System** is an advanced Artificial Intelligence project designed to identify and classify different types of fake or manipulated digital content. In today's digital era, misinformation spreads rapidly through news articles, manipulated images, AI-generated audio, and deepfake videos. This project aims to tackle these challenges by combining multiple AI models into a single intelligent system capable of detecting fake media across various formats.

This project uses a **multimodal approach**, meaning it does not rely on only one type of data. Instead, it analyzes and predicts authenticity from:

* 📰 Text News
* 🖼️ Images
* 🎙️ Audio
* 🎥 Videos

Each module has been trained separately using specialized Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques optimized for its respective media type.

The system demonstrates how AI can be used to combat misinformation, improve media verification, and contribute toward safer digital communication.

# 🚀 Problem Statement

With the rise of social media and AI-generated content, fake media has become increasingly difficult to identify manually. Traditional detection systems usually focus on a single modality such as text or image only.

However, real-world misinformation spreads through multiple formats simultaneously.

Examples include:

* Fake news articles
* Edited or AI-generated images
* Voice cloning and synthetic speech
* Deepfake face-swapped videos

This project addresses these problems using a **single multimodal framework** capable of detecting fake content from multiple sources.

---

# 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* Detect fake and real news articles
* Identify manipulated or AI-generated images
* Classify fake and real audio
* Detect deepfake or manipulated videos
* Demonstrate multimodal AI integration
* Provide an intelligent and scalable misinformation detection framework
